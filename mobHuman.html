						<p>Comes in 3 unique flavors!</p>
					<h3>Primial</h3>
						<p>Your average Joe.</p>
						<p>Primials were the first sentient beings on the planet, though not for long.</p>
						<p>They make up most of the population at about 40% and are most adaptable.</p>
						<p>Though they carry no great weight as a race, many kingdoms are ruled by Primials.</p>
					<h3>Silf</h3>
						<p>Taller than Primials and extra pointy ears.</p>
						<p>Silf are born prodigeous, with almost super intelligence.</p>
						<p>With their natural wisdom they typically study at the Hall of Myr.</p>
						<p>The Council of White Knights consists mainly of Silf at about 60%.<p>
					<h3>Keeper</h3>
						<p>Shorter than Primials with a knack for growing beards.</p>
						<p>Keepers dwell beneath the earth closer to the core of the planet.</p>
						<p>Keepers are thought to watch over the core and fuel it when it's light dims.</p>
						<p>Keepers are also known for hording minerals within a labyrinth beneath the surface.</p>
