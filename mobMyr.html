			/*					<p>Myr is seen in three categories, Red, Black and White.</p>
					<h3>Red Myr</h3>
						<p>Physical in every sense.</p>
						<p>From quick healing to litterally explosive kicks.</p>
						<p>Popular among Adventurers.</p>
					<h3>Black Myr</h3>
						<p>This type is tricky.</p>
						<p>It can control beings and create illusions that act like the real thing.</p>
						<p>Some illusions are strong enough to break the mind or cause physical injury.</p>
					<h3>White Myr</h3>
						<p>White Myr can cast physical representations of elements.</p>
						<p>It can create them in just about any form as well.</p>
						<p>Most people can't tell the difference between White Myr and Black Myr in this regard.</p>
					<h3>How Myr Works</h3>
						<p>All players have Myr Ability Points,</p>
						<p>Myr Ability Points determine how many Myr abilities you can use in a day.</p>
						<p>Unlike Combat Ability Points, Myr Ability Points only regenerate after rests.</p>
						<p>Short Rest(1D) Long Rest(2D) and a Full Night's Rest restores all Myr Ability Points.</p>
					<h3>Myr Abilities</h3>
					<p>Unlike your standard magic system, Myr is 90% user created.</p>
					<p>Myr requires two things an action and a restraint.</p>
					<p>The more restraints the more powerful the action.</p>
					<p>Restraints can include Items needed, not being able to attack a certain group, using multiple Myr Ability Points, etc.</p>*/
